Stroke Prediction Using Deep Learning

My project make it possible to predict second stroke based on parameters observed during the time of first stroke occurence. Even though the AUC-ROC as well as Accuracy is not very high but if it would be trained with more numerical variables/parameters, the efficiency of my model could increase.

Due to high imbalance in my dataset, I have used Under sampling.

I would also be performing ML Deep learning using Over sampling in order to use validation set training as well.
